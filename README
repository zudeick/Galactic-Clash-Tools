Informations & Instructions

Prologue
I decided to quit playing GC.
But as I invested a lot of time into those Scripts provided here,
I decided to do not just delete them all and give some other
interested Devlopers and Scripters the possibility to continue and improve my work.
With this in Mind, I wish you all the best and lots of fun.

Your Options:
You have two options of gathering informations.
1). with a Linux Server, OpenVPN and a Android Mobile
2). with a Windows PC, a Android Emulator (Andyroid / Bluestacks)

The way you should go depends on what you want / need / planning to do.

With the First Option you'll get all informations about all Accounts that you run on your Android Device
including all informations you'll get with the Second Option.

The Second Option is the more easy way, but its only for getting Galaxy informations
(Planet positions, Alliance and Player names, Debris Fields).

...The Easy way first...
 - Setup your Android Emulator (+ your GC Client)
 - Setup Wireshark
 - Setup ADB (Android Debuging Bridge)
 - Setup "Galactic-Clash-Tools.properties" with you Properties
 - Start Wireshark, start logging all GC Traffic
 - Run ADBClient.java
 - Save all Packeges logged with Wireshark as Text File (with Bytes, without headers, paged)
 - Run ImportTCPDump.java
 
 Now you have all Galaxy Informations as JSON Text in your DB. Parse it and do whatever you like with the Informations.
 
 ...and now the more complex way...
